# hashleaf
Hash cracking tool written in python, works by encrypting the list of passwords and matching it with the users desired hash and returns results IF the password text file contains the plaintext version of the users hash.

# Why?
Cool little project, but this is the first project i've made that uses an actual implementation of classes in python, another thing i like about this algorithm is unlike calculator and simple-hash-tool, projects i made earlier on i've improved in terms of saving space a little. Now instead of making a function for each encryption I can keep it all in the same function.

With this program it requires only one function utilising f-strings to change certain parts of the code which is something i didn't know you could do back then. 

# Summary

Anyways, thanks for reading.
